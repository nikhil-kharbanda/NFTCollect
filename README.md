## Description
  “Non-fungible” means that it’s unique and can’t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible — trade one for another bitcoin, and you’ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you’d have something completely different. 

  In this project, I have created an "Instagram" for collectable NFT's.

  Users can upload their NFT's along with a caption and a description, as well as comment on other peoples NFT's.

  Users who post their NFT up also have the ability to delete that post
